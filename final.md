CN Lab Program list
1. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client send the file name
and the server to send back the contents of the requested file name “sample.txt”
with the following contents: “Hello we are at Computer Networks Lab” Display                                  Tough
suitable error message in case the file is not present in the server.


2. Write a program to find shortest paths from source to all nodes in the network graph                       Revise tough
using Bellman Ford Algorithm.


3. Write a program to find shortest paths from source to all nodes in the network graph                       Invalid???           
using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.           


4. Write a program for implementing the error detection technique for data transfer in                         Not impossible
unreliable network code using CRC (16-bits) Technique.


5. Write a program to implement internet checksum for error correction and detection.                          Possible


6. Write a program to achieve Traffic management at Flow level by implementing Leaky                            Done
Bucket Algorithm.   

7. Packets from different flows arrive at a switch or router for processing. A good
scheduling technique treats the different flows in a fair and appropriate manner.                               Possible
Implement priority queuing as a technique to improve Quality of Service.

8. Write a program to imcplement Go Back N sliding window protocol                                              Done

9. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to enrypt and decrypt the data                                      Done
