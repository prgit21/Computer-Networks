1. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client-server program to make client send the file name
and the server to send back the contents of the requested file name “sample.txt”
with the following contents: “Hello we are at Computer Networks Lab” Display
suitable error message in case the file is not present in the server.



2. Write a program to implement a chat application, where the Client establishes a
connection with the Server. The Client and Server can send as well as receive
messages at the same time. Both the Client and Server exchange messages



3. Given a graph, each node A knows the shortest path to node Z and node A can
determine its shortest path to Z by calculating the minimum cost. Now when packet
flows through a path it incurs some cost to the network, find shortest paths from
source to all nodes in the given graph using Bellman Ford Algorithm. The graph may
contain negative weight edges.



4. Given a graph find shortest paths from source to all nodes in the graph using
Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.


5. Write a program for implementing the error detection technique for data transfer in
unreliable network code using CRC (16-bits) Technique.


6. Write a program to implement internet checksum for error correction and detection.


7. Write a program to achieve Traffic management at Flow level by implementing Leaky
Bucket Algorithm.



8. Packets from different flows arrive at a switch or router for processing. A good
scheduling technique treats the different flows in a fair and appropriate manner.
Implement priority queuing as a technique to improve Quality of Service.


9. Write a program to implement Go Back N sliding window protocol


10. Write a program to implement Selective repeat sliding window protocol


11. Write a program to implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm.


12. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data
