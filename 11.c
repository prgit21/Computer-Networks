/*The algorithm in itself is very simple. Let’s assume that Alice wants to
establish a shared secret with Bob. Here is an example of the protocol with
secret values in red.
1. Alice and Bob agree to use a prime number p = 23 and base g = 5.
(These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting
shared secret can take on any value from 1 to p–1).
2. Alice chooses a secret integer a = 6, then sends Bob A = ga mod p (A
= 56 mod 23 = 8)
3. Bob chooses a secret integer b = 15, then sends Alice B = gb mod p (B
= 515 mod 23 = 19)
4. Alice computes s = Ba mod p (s = 196 mod 23 = 2)
5. Bob computes s = Ab mod p (s = 815 mod 23 = 2)
6. Alice and Bob now share a secret (the number 2).
The number Alice get at step 4 is same as Bob got at step 5 as
Bob computes
Ab mod p = (ga mod p)b mod p = gab mod p
Alice computes
Ba mod p = (gb mod p)a mod p = gba mod p
